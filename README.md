# Introduction 

This repository contains various explorations I have been doing on creating/transforming my artworks using computer neural networks.

# My Artworks

I have been taking art classes since I was six.  Over the years I have learned different art styles: sketches, watercolors, oil paintings, sculptures, mangas ...

# Neural Art

As I grow up, I become heavily involved in computer programming and machine learning projects.  I discovered that I can create or transform many of my paintings in an exotic way, that totally changed my view on arts.

## Transfer Art Style -- You can be Monet

I like water ponds and enjoy the serenity of the still life on the pond.  I draw this pond picture several years in my art class:

I was quite happy about my drawings until I saw this water lilly pond painting from Claude Monet:

How can I draw like Monet?  My art teacher didn't know how to paint impressionistically but I explore the internet and found people were publishing papers on transfering artist style onto a subject painting.  I happened to learn computer neural networks during this time and after some experimentation, I was able to apply Monet's style onto my water pond picture.  Take a look to see how I did it:
